Article: [With AI Writing Code, Will AI Replace Programmers?](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/ai-writing-code-will-ai-replace-programmers#:~:text=AI%20won%27t%20replace%20programmers,development%20in%20the%20near%20future.) by Richard Bellairs

I was attracted to this article because I had recently been introduced to a very well-trained AI novel writer, which arose a question mark in me on to what degree can AI replace human creativity. I was impressed by the fact that such a large proportion (29%) of software developers in a survey expressed that their greatest concern about their career is to be replaced by AI code writers. 

The conclusion of this article is surprisingly similar to my experience with the AI writer: it was capable of writing readable, coherent paragraphs, but does not know what to write, and this is where human inspiration becomea crucial. It indeed sounds promising that AI will become a clever coding parterner for software developers to write better code and code more efficiently.
